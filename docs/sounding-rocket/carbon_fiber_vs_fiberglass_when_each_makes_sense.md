Carbon Fiber vs. Fiberglass: When Each Makes Sense

The selection between carbon fiber and fiberglass composites represents one of the most critical material decisions in amateur rocketry construction. While both materials offer significant advantages over traditional phenolic tubes or aluminum, their specific applications deserve careful consideration based on mission parameters and practical constraints.

Carbon fiber's primary advantage lies in its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, typically offering 2-3 times the specific strength of fiberglass. A 4-inch diameter airframe section built with two layers of 5.7oz carbon fiber weighs approximately 40% less than its fiberglass equivalent while providing comparable structural integrity. However, this weight advantage comes at a significant cost premium - often 3-4 times the price per square foot compared to equivalent fiberglass cloth.

The carbon fiber curve (in black) shows a steeper initial slope and higher ultimate strength but exhibits sudden catastrophic failure. The fiberglass curve (in blue) shows more gradual failure progression with visible strain before ultimate failure. Data points are collected from standardized tensile tests on 2-layer layups using West System epoxy. The x-axis shows strain percentage (0-5%), while the y-axis shows stress in MPa (0-800).

The failure modes of these materials differ significantly. Carbon fiber tends to fail catastrophically with little warning, while fiberglass typically shows progressive failure with visible stress indicators. This characteristic makes fiberglass particularly suitable for recovery sections where controlled deformation during deployment events can prevent catastrophic failures.

Radio frequency (RF) transparency presents another crucial consideration. Carbon fiber's electrical conductivity creates an effective Faraday cage, potentially blocking radio signals from tracking devices and altimeters. Testing has shown signal attenuation of 20-30 dB through carbon fiber sections, while fiberglass remains essentially transparent to RF. This makes fiberglass the preferred choice for electronic bay sections and payload compartments requiring radio communication.

Metrics include specific strength, RF transparency, impact resistance, and cost per square foot. Each metric is normalized to a 0-100 scale. The graph clearly shows carbon fiber's dominance in strength but poor RF performance, while fiberglass shows balanced performance across all metrics with cost advantage.

Temperature resistance varies between the materials, with carbon fiber maintaining structural integrity up to approximately 315째C (600째F) before epoxy degradation, while standard fiberglass systems typically limit at 200째C (392째F). This difference becomes particularly relevant in high-speed flights where aerodynamic heating can become significant, especially around fin roots and nose cones.

The decision matrix often favors a hybrid approach: carbon fiber for fin cans and high-stress structural components, fiberglass for electronic bays and recovery sections. This combination optimizes both performance and practicality. For rockets targeting altitudes below 20,000 feet or velocities under Mach 1.5, fiberglass often provides the best value proposition. The material cost savings can be redirected toward other system improvements like dual deployment electronics or improved recovery systems.

Construction techniques also influence material selection. Fiberglass typically proves more forgiving during wet layup processes, with better drapability around complex shapes and more consistent results for novice builders. Carbon fiber demands more precise handling, with air bubble prevention and fiber orientation being particularly critical. The black color of carbon fiber makes visual inspection for voids and delamination more challenging compared to natural or white fiberglass.

For competition vehicles where every gram matters, carbon fiber remains the gold standard, particularly in minimum diameter projects targeting extreme altitudes. However, for general sport flying and educational projects, fiberglass provides an excellent balance of performance, cost, and practicality. The material choice ultimately depends on a careful analysis of mission requirements, budget constraints, and builder experience level.
