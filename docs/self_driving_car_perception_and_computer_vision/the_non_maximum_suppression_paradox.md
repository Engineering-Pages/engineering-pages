# The Non-Maximum Suppression Paradox

The Non-Maximum Suppression Paradox

Non-maximum suppression (NMS) appears deceptively simple: keep the strongest detections and remove weaker, overlapping ones. Yet this fundamental computer vision operation harbors surprising complexities that can critically impact real-world applications.

Consider a typical object detection scenario where multiple bounding boxes are predicted around a single object. While humans can easily identify redundant detections, NMS must make these decisions using only intersection-over-union (IoU) scores and confidence values. This leads to our first paradox: stronger confidence doesn't always mean better localization.

Top right: Standard NMS result keeping highest confidence box. Bottom left: Ground truth box shown in green. Bottom right: Overlay showing that a lower confidence detection (blue) actually had better IoU with ground truth than the retained high confidence box (red). Arrows and annotations highlight how the highest confidence detection was actually less accurate in localization.

This phenomenon occurs because modern neural networks often exhibit higher confidence for slightly misaligned boxes that capture discriminative features rather than boxes that precisely bound the object. In practice, a detection shifted to include a person's characteristic face may score higher confidence than one that perfectly aligns with their full body.

The problem compounds when dealing with occluded or densely packed objects. Traditional NMS uses a fixed IoU threshold to determine which detections to suppress. But this binary decision boundary creates a second paradox: we must choose between over-suppression (losing distinct objects) or under-suppression (keeping duplicates).

Right: NMS with low threshold (0.3) showing missing detections where distinct objects were incorrectly suppressed. Red boxes indicate problematic areas in each case.

Modern approaches attempt to address these issues through soft-NMS, learning-based NMS, or distance-based penalties. However, each solution introduces its own trade-offs. Soft-NMS reduces scores gradually based on overlap, but struggles to handle cases where high overlap is expected (like people in a crowd). Learning-based methods can adapt to specific scenarios but require extensive training data and may not generalize well.

The engineering implications are significant. When building real-world detection systems, we must carefully consider the application context. For autonomous vehicles, false negatives could be catastrophic, suggesting a higher NMS threshold. For crowd counting applications, we might need adaptive thresholds based on scene density.

Recent work explores instance embedding approaches that sidestep traditional NMS entirely by learning to group pixels belonging to the same object. While promising, these methods introduce new challenges around embedding space design and clustering.

Color coding indicates true positives (green), false positives (red), and false negatives (blue). Performance metrics and timing data are annotated below each result.

The paradox ultimately reveals a deeper truth: the apparently simple task of deciding which detections to keep cannot be solved through purely geometric reasoning. It requires semantic understanding of object relationships, scene context, and application-specific priorities. As we build more sophisticated vision systems, we must remain mindful of these fundamental limitations and design appropriate fallback behaviors when our assumptions break down.

In practice, successful implementations often combine multiple approaches: using traditional NMS for well-separated objects, switching to soft-NMS in crowded regions, and incorporating domain-specific heuristics. The key is to understand the trade-offs and failure modes of each approach, rather than treating NMS as a solved problem.
