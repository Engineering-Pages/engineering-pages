# Post-Flight Data Analysis and Performance Validation

Post-Flight Data Analysis and Performance Validation

The difference between a casual rocket flight and a meaningful engineering exercise lies primarily in how thoroughly we analyze the data afterward. While watching a successful recovery is satisfying, the real insights come from careful examination of flight data, comparing predicted versus actual performance, and understanding any discrepancies.

Modern altimeters typically record pressure, acceleration, and sometimes temperature at rates between 10-100 samples per second. This raw data requires several preprocessing steps before it becomes useful. Barometric data must be corrected for the day's ground-level pressure and temperature lapse rate. Acceleration data usually needs filtering to remove launch rail vibration and motor burn acoustics. A simple moving average filter works for subsonic flights, but supersonic flights often require more sophisticated Kalman filtering to maintain accuracy through the transonic region.

Middle panel shows vertical acceleration with motor burn signature clearly visible. Bottom panel shows calculated velocity with characteristic parabolic shape. Notable events (motor burnout, apogee, recovery deployment) are marked with vertical dashed lines. The disparity between barometric and accelerometer-derived altitude traces grows during powered flight but converges after apogee, demonstrating typical sensor fusion challenges.

One of the most valuable validation techniques is comparing multiple data sources. A properly integrated acceleration curve should match the barometric altitude profile within 2-3% for subsonic flights. Larger discrepancies often indicate calibration problems or structural flexing that couples into the accelerometer mounting. The velocity curve, derived from either data source, should show clear evidence of expected events like motor burnout, coast phase drag effects, and recovery deployment.

Weather conditions play a crucial role in validation. Wind profile data from balloon soundings or local weather stations should be incorporated into the analysis. Even slight winds can significantly affect both the altitude achieved and drift distance. Modern flight simulation software can import actual weather data, allowing for precise matching of predicted and actual trajectories.

Perfect prediction would fall on diagonal line. Most points cluster within Â±5% of predicted values, with outliers annotated to show identified cause (wind shear, motor variation, etc). Color coding indicates flight Mach number ranges.

Motor performance validation deserves particular attention. The actual thrust curve often differs from published data due to temperature effects and manufacturing variations. By comparing the acceleration profile during boost with the expected thrust curve, we can quantify these differences. Consistent deviation might indicate systematic errors in aerodynamic modeling or mass distribution.

A comprehensive analysis should examine:
- Maximum altitude and time to apogee
- Descent rate under recovery device
- Maximum acceleration and velocity
- Roll rate (if measured)
- Recovery system deployment timing
- Drift distance versus prediction
- Temperature profile during flight
- Battery voltage stability

The goal isn't just to collect numbers but to build a feedback loop that improves future designs. When actual performance matches predictions within 1-2%, we can be confident in our modeling assumptions. Larger discrepancies should trigger detailed investigation - perhaps revealing unexpected phenomena like fin flutter, recovery system interference, or pressure port location effects.

Documentation is crucial. Each flight analysis should generate a standardized report including raw data, processing methods, weather conditions, and comparison to predictions. Over time, this creates a valuable database for identifying trends and improving design methods. The most successful rocket developers maintain detailed flight histories spanning hundreds of launches, allowing them to spot subtle patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed.

Remember that validation isn't about proving you were right - it's about understanding where and why you were wrong, and using that knowledge to make better predictions next time. Even "perfect" flights deserve scrutiny, as they might be masking offsetting errors that could cause problems under slightly different conditions.
