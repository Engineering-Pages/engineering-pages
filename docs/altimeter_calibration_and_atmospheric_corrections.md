# Altimeter Calibration and Atmospheric Corrections

Altimeter Calibration and Atmospheric Corrections

The accuracy of altitude measurements in sounding rockets presents unique challenges that extend beyond simple barometric pressure readings. While commercial altimeters often claim "within 0.1% accuracy," actual field performance can deviate significantly due to atmospheric variations and calibration issues.

Modern altimeters use pressure sensors that measure atmospheric pressure relative to a reference value. This reference, typically captured at launch site initialization, becomes the basis for all subsequent altitude calculations. However, the assumption of a standard atmosphere (1013.25 mbar at sea level, decreasing at approximately 1 mbar per 27 feet) rarely matches real-world conditions.

Graph showing altitude error vs. actual altitude for three different calibration methods. The x-axis spans 0-30,000 feet, while y-axis shows error in feet (-500 to +500). Three curves are plotted: uncorrected readings (red), temperature-compensated readings (blue), and fully corrected readings including humidity (green). The uncorrected line shows increasing error with altitude, while temperature compensation reduces error by roughly 60%. The fully corrected line maintains error below ±50 feet throughout the range. Reference points from actual flight data are marked as black dots.

Temperature effects on pressure sensors create another layer of complexity. Most commercial altimeters include temperature compensation, but their correction algorithms assume a standard lapse rate of -3.56°F per 1,000 feet. During actual flights, temperature inversions and unusual atmospheric conditions can create significant deviations from this assumption.

Practical calibration requires attention to several key factors:

1. Ground Level Calibration: Allow sufficient warm-up time (minimum 3 minutes) for sensor temperature stabilization before capturing reference pressure. Multiple readings averaged over 30 seconds provide better baseline accuracy than single-point measurements.

2. Temperature Compensation: For flights above 10,000 feet, launch day atmospheric sounding data becomes crucial. Modern altimeters allow input of actual lapse rate values, significantly improving accuracy in the upper atmosphere.

3. Humidity Effects: While often overlooked, water vapor content affects air density and thus pressure readings. High humidity can cause altitude overestimation by up to 2% unless properly compensated.

The chamber allows controlled variation of temperature (-20°C to +40°C) and pressure (1100 to 100 mbar). Data points are collected at 5°C intervals across the full pressure range, creating a comprehensive calibration matrix. Correction factors derived from this matrix are shown in an inset table.

Field testing reveals that altimeter accuracy often degrades above 20,000 feet, where the combination of low pressure and extreme temperatures challenges sensor capabilities. Some advanced users employ dual-sensor configurations, combining barometric readings with GPS data for cross-validation. This approach helps identify systematic errors and provides redundancy for critical altitude measurements.

The timing of calibration also matters. Atmospheric pressure varies throughout the day, with morning conditions often differing significantly from afternoon. For competition flights where precise altitude measurement is crucial, recalibration should be performed within 30 minutes of launch.

Recent developments in digital pressure sensors have introduced active temperature compensation and real-time humidity correction. These systems can maintain accuracy within ±0.3% across the entire flight envelope, provided proper calibration procedures are followed. However, they require more sophisticated ground support equipment and careful attention to environmental conditions during the calibration process.

The ultimate accuracy achievable depends on careful attention to these factors and understanding their interrelationships. Regular calibration against a known pressure standard, combined with proper compensation for environmental factors, can maintain altitude measurement accuracy within ±50 feet up to 10,000 feet, degrading to approximately ±200 feet at 30,000 feet under typical atmospheric conditions.
