# Weather-Related Launch Decisions

Weather-Related Launch Decisions

The relationship between weather conditions and successful rocket launches represents one of the most critical yet frequently underappreciated aspects of amateur rocketry. While commercial space operations have dedicated meteorological teams and can often wait for perfect conditions, amateur rocketeers must develop expertise in interpreting weather data and making judgment calls with limited resources.

Wind conditions create the most immediate concern for launch decisions. Surface winds affect rail departure dynamics, while winds aloft influence recovery operations. A comprehensive analysis of 1,500 high-power rocket flights reveals that surface winds below 10 mph result in a 95% success rate for rail departure, dropping to 72% between 10-15 mph, and below 40% for winds exceeding 15 mph.

Three colored lines represent different rocket weight classes: under 5 lbs (blue), 5-15 lbs (green), and over 15 lbs (red). All lines show steep decline after 10 mph, with heavier rockets maintaining higher success rates in stronger winds. Dotted vertical line at 15 mph indicates typical "no-go" threshold for most launches.

The wind profile through the flight envelope demands equal attention. Traditional wisdom suggesting "if you can see the clouds, you can fly to them" proves dangerously simplistic. Modern wind mapping tools like radiosondes and wind weight calculations provide crucial data for predicting drift patterns. The "60% rule" - allowing drift up to 60% of the expected altitude - offers a practical guideline for setting field boundaries, though this assumes uniform wind direction through the altitude profile.

Temperature affects motor performance significantly. Ammonium perchlorate composite propellant (APCP) motors show approximately 1.2% thrust variation per 10°F deviation from their 70°F baseline. More critically, temperature cycling can create separation between the propellant grain and motor casing, leading to catastrophic failure modes.

Data points from actual flight records cluster around a linear trend line with clear positive correlation. Secondary Y-axis shows failure rate increasing sharply below 40°F and above 90°F. Shaded green region indicates optimal temperature range.

Humidity impacts both electronic systems and recovery components. Electronic altimeters typically maintain accuracy up to 95% relative humidity, but condensation on circuit boards during descent can trigger false readings or premature ejection events. Recovery systems face different challenges - Kevlar and nylon shock cords can absorb up to 3.5% of their weight in moisture, significantly affecting their elastic properties and breaking strength.

The presence of thermal activity (thermals) requires special consideration. While thermals can provide additional altitude, they create unpredictable recovery patterns. A study of 500 flights during peak thermal conditions (11:00 AM - 3:00 PM) showed recovery distances averaging 30% greater than similar flights in early morning or late afternoon conditions.

Practical decision-making requires establishing clear go/no-go criteria before reaching the field. A systematic approach using a weather decision matrix helps remove emotion from the process:

1. Surface winds < 15 mph
2. Winds aloft < 20 mph through recovery altitude
3. Temperature 40-90°F
4. Visibility > 3 miles
5. Cloud ceiling > 150% of planned altitude
6. No precipitation within 10 miles
7. No lightning within 30 miles

Meeting all criteria indicates favorable conditions. Missing any single criterion requires careful evaluation of risk vs. reward, while failing multiple criteria should automatically scrub the launch. The matrix should be adjusted based on specific rocket characteristics and field conditions.

Modern weather resources like RAOB (RAwinsonde OBservation) data and real-time wind profiling have dramatically improved our ability to make informed launch decisions. However, the fundamental principle remains unchanged: when in doubt, wait it out. The cost of a scrubbed launch always remains lower than the cost of a weather-related failure.
