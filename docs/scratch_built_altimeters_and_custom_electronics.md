# Scratch-Built Altimeters and Custom Electronics

Building your own altimeter for sounding rockets represents one of the most rewarding challenges in amateur rocketry. While commercial altimeters are readily available, scratch-built solutions offer unique advantages in terms of customization, cost, and educational value.

The core of any altimeter system consists of three fundamental components: the pressure sensor, the microcontroller, and the data storage system. Modern MEMS barometric pressure sensors like the BMP280 or MS5611 provide excellent resolution down to 0.1 meters while consuming minimal power. The selection between these sensors often comes down to a trade-off between sampling rate and precision.

Key features include pull-up resistors for I2C lines, decoupling capacitors, and voltage divider for battery monitoring. Connection points for optional components like GPS module and radio telemetry are indicated with dotted lines. Power supply section shows battery input through reverse polarity protection.

The microcontroller choice significantly impacts system capabilities. While an Arduino Nano provides an accessible starting point, purpose-built solutions using bare ATmega chips offer advantages in size and power consumption. The ATmega328P running at 16MHz provides sufficient processing power for most applications, though more demanding requirements might justify moving to ARM-based processors.

Data storage presents interesting design decisions. While SD cards offer enormous capacity, their power consumption and reliability concerns make serial EEPROM chips like the 24LC256 attractive for many applications. These chips can store several flights worth of data while maintaining excellent shock resistance.

The pressure-to-altitude conversion requires careful consideration of atmospheric conditions. The standard atmospheric model provides reasonable accuracy, but incorporating ground-level calibration and temperature compensation significantly improves results. Consider this basic conversion equation:

X-axis shows pressure in millibars from 1013 to 100, Y-axis shows altitude in meters from 0 to 10,000. Temperature compensation curve shows improved accuracy especially in middle altitudes between 3,000-7,000 meters where standard atmosphere model typically deviates most.

Power management becomes critical for reliable operation. While lithium batteries offer excellent energy density, their voltage characteristics require careful regulation. A low-dropout regulator providing stable 3.3V proves essential for sensor accuracy. Implementing sleep modes between samples can extend battery life from hours to months.

The challenge of noise rejection cannot be overstated. High-G events during motor burn and recovery deployment can create false readings. Digital filtering techniques, particularly moving averages and Kalman filters, help separate signal from noise. The optimal filter depends on your sampling rate and expected acceleration profile:

Notable events marked include launch, motor burnout, and ejection charge firing. Demonstrates superior noise rejection of Kalman filter while maintaining rapid response to actual altitude changes.

Mechanical integration demands careful attention to pressure port design. While static ports work well for subsonic flights, supersonic applications require specialized considerations to prevent shock wave interference. A simple solution involves multiple sampling ports averaged together, though more sophisticated approaches using pitot-static principles can provide better results.

The firmware architecture should prioritize reliability over features. Implementing watchdog timers and redundant storage helps prevent data loss. Many successful designs use a state machine approach, transitioning between ground, boost, coast, and recovery phases based on pressure trends rather than absolute values.

Testing becomes crucial for validation. A vacuum chamber can simulate altitude changes, while car tests help verify GPS integration and radio telemetry. Remember that FAA regulations may require specific certifications for radio-equipped devices, though basic altimeters typically fall under amateur radio exemptions.

The future of scratch-built altimeters lies in sensor fusion. Combining barometric data with accelerometer and GPS inputs can provide more robust altitude solutions. Modern MEMS devices like the BMI088 offer excellent performance for multi-sensor integration, though the software complexity increases significantly.
